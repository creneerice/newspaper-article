      <p class="text">Today marks a historic occasion. Ruby O., age 20 weeks, has figured out how to get her knees under her, leading to the ability to scoot herself forward. This is something she has been trying to master for the past week or two, since she was able to get onto her stomach and raise her head. It won't be long before she is unstoppable!</p>
      <p class="text">Ruby has shown fierce determination since the day of her birth 20 weeks ago. She was diagnosed with Down syndrome, which can lead to low muscle tone and developmental delays. However, Ruby does not let her diagnosis define her. She rolled over for the first time at 3 1/2 months old, which is ahead of the time frame for typical babies. Since then, she has been determined to get moving! Day and night Ruby practices rolling over and raising her head as high as she can. Her dedication to this practice has enabled her to grow stronger every day. Today, when waking up from her nap, she was so eager to get up and play that she scooted her knees under her stomach and raised up. Once in this position, she realized the world was her oyster and she thrust herself forward, resulting in forward momentum in her crib. We will continue to monitor this story and update everyone as the situation progresses. Stay tuned!</p>
